# vim-table-mode-to-csv
a script to convert vim-table-mode file into csv (comma-separated
values) file

vim-table-mode-to-csv is a script which converts plain text generated
from [vim-table-mode](https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-table-mode). into csv file, ready to be imported into any
spreadsheet program such as LibreOffice Calc or Google Sheets.

# Why do I write this script?

When I have to keep log of expenses of a group of people who travel
together, I use vim-table-mode instead of LibreOffice Calc as it is
easier to use Git to track the changes.  After the trip, I need to
migrate the plain text data into a spreadsheet software (such as
LibreOffice Calc or Google Sheets) so that I can use the spreadsheet
formulas to calculate the expenses for each person.
